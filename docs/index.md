# LingQ CLI Documentation

Welcome to the LingQ CLI documentation! This tool provides command-line utilities for interacting with [LingQ's](https://www.lingq.com/) API, making it easy to automate and enhance your language learning workflows.

## What is LingQ CLI?

LingQ CLI is a comprehensive command-line tool that allows you to:

- 📤 **Upload content** - Bulk upload lessons with text and audio to your LingQ courses
- 🎥 **YouTube integration** - Import entire YouTube playlists with automatic caption extraction
- ⏱️ **Generate timestamps** - Automatically create timestamps for your audio lessons
- 📥 **Download content** - Export lessons, courses, and vocabulary (LingQs)
- 📝 **Markdown documentation** - Generate markdown documentation of your courses
- 📚 **Yomitan dictionaries** - Convert your LingQ vocabulary to Yomitan dictionary format
- 🔧 **Manage courses** - Sort, reindex, merge, and organize your lessons

## Quick Start

Get started in just a few steps:

1. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   pip install lingq
   ```

2. **Configure your API key**
   ```bash
   lingq setup yourLingqApiKey
   ```

3. **Start using the CLI**
   ```bash
   # Upload a YouTube playlist to a course (replace 129129 with your course ID)
   lingq postyt el 129129 "https://www.youtube.com/@awesomeyoutuber"
   
   # Bulk upload a book split by chapters
   lingq post el 129139 "example/texts" -a "example/audios" --pairing-strategy zip
   
   # Generate timestamps for an entire course
   lingq timestamp de 129129
   ```
